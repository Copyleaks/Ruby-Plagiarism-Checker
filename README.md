require 'copyleaks'
require 'base64'

# --- Your Credentials ---
USER_EMAIL = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS'
USER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://your-server.com/webhook/{STATUS}'
# --------------------

begin
    scanId = DateTime.now.strftime('%Q').to_s
    text = "Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, typically consisting of several females, their offspring, and a few males. Female lions are the primary hunters, working together to catch prey. Lions are known for their strength, teamwork, and complex social structures."
    submission = Copyleaks::NaturalLanguageSubmissionModel.new(
      text,
    )
    submission.sandbox = true
    
    res = @copyleaks.ai_detection_client.submit_natural_language(_authToken, scanId, submission)

end
```
